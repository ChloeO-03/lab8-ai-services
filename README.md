# Lab 8: AI Services Chat Application

A sophisticated chat application demonstrating the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern with a flexible service layer that supports multiple AI providers. Built to showcase professional software engineering practices including the Strategy pattern, dependency injection, and comprehensive E2E testing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This application refactors a traditional chatbot to support swappable AI services through the Service Layer pattern, allowing users to seamlessly switch between:

- **ðŸ¤– Eliza (Local)** - Classic pattern-matching chatbot (free, private, offline)
- **âœ¨ Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** - Advanced AI with natural language understanding
- **ðŸ§  OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-3.5)** - Industry-leading conversational AI

The project demonstrates key software engineering principles:
- **Service Layer Pattern** - Abstraction layer for AI providers
- **Strategy Pattern** - Swappable algorithm implementations
- **MVC Architecture** - Separation of concerns
- **Observer Pattern** - Reactive data updates
- **Dependency Injection** - Loose coupling between components
